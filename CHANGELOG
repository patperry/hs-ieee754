Changes in 0.8.0:

* Daniel Mendler added minDenormal.


Changes in 0.7.9:

* Rename nextup/nextdown to ieeesucc/ieeepred to avoid clashes with
  libm functions (fixes issue #15, reported by @clinty)


Changes in 0.7.8:

* Alain O'Dea fixed broken illumos build.

* Simplified endianness detection in C code.


Changes in 0.7.7:

* Johan Kiviniemi added tests for minNormal, maxFinite, epsilon,
  maxNaNPayload.


Changes in 0.7.6:

* Fix broken windows build.


Changes in 0.7.5:

* Added more robust check for endianness (related to issue #5, reported by @juricast).


Changes in 0.7.4:

* Add C implementation of copysign, copysignf

* Remove libm dependency

* Anders Kaseorg fixed documentation for epsilon.


Changes in 0.7.3:

* Bugfix from BjÃ¶rn Buckwalter: any two negative values were approxEqIEEE


Changes in 0.7.2:

* Fix aliasing warnings in C code


Changes in 0.7.1:

* Rename package from "ieee" to "ieee754"


Changes in 0.7:

* Add IEEE type class with instances for Double, Float, CDouble, and CFloat

* Add functions for getting/setting NaN payloads

* Add succIEEE/predIEEE for advancing up and down the IEEE number line
  (ported from Tango's nextUp and nextDown)

* Add bisectIEEE for midpoints of two numbers on the IEEE number line
  (ported from Tango's ieeeMean)

* Add identicalIEEE for exact (bitwise) equality of IEEE numbers

* Add copySign for setting the sign bit of an IEEE number

* Add sameSignificandBits for seeing how many significand bits of two
  IEEE numbers agree, ported from Tango's feqrel

* Add nan, infinity, maxFinite, minNormal constants for IEEE numbers

* Add maxNum and minNum

* Rename maxF and minF to maxNaN and minNaN

* Switch to a simpler "~==" comparison for complex numbers

* Make "~==" comparison use sameSignificandBits for IEEE types

* Make "===" comparison use bitwise equality for IEEE types

* Remove old "eqRel" comparisons.

* Remove old epsilon' and delta constants

* Remove (RealFloat a) => AEq (Complex a) instance in favor of explicit
  instances for Complex {Double,Float,CDouble,CFloat}


Changes in 0.6.1:

 * Remove AEq instance for CLDouble (thanks to Bjorn Buckwalter)
