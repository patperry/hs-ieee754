Changes in 0.7:

* Add IEEE type class with instances for Double, Float, CDouble, and CFloat

* Add functions for getting/setting NaN payloads

* Add succIEEE/predIEEE for advancing up and down the IEEE number line
  (ported from Tango's nextUp and nextDown)

* Add bisectIEEE for midpoints of two numbers on the IEEE number line
  (ported from Tango's ieeeMean)

* Add identicalIEEE for exact (bitwise) equality of IEEE numbers

* Add copySign for setting the sign bit of an IEEE number

* Add sameSignificandBits for seeing how many significand bits of two
  IEEE numbers agree, ported from Tango's feqrel

* Add nan, infinity, maxFinite, minNormal constants for IEEE numbers

* Add maxNum and minNum

* Rename maxF and minF to maxNaN and minNaN

* Switch to a simpler "~==" comparison for complex numbers

* Make "~==" comparison use sameSignificandBits for IEEE types

* Make "===" comparison use bitwise equality for IEEE types

* Remove old "eqRel" comparisons.

* Remove old epsilon' and delta constants

* Remove (RealFloat a) => AEq (Complex a) instance in favor of explicit
  instances for Complex {Double,Float,CDouble,CFloat}


Changes in 0.6.1:

 * Remove AEq instance for CLDouble (thanks to Bjorn Buckwalter)
